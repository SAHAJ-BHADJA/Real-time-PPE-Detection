# PPE Detection for Construction Site Safety 

Workers in transportation and material moving occupations and construction and extraction occupations accounted for nearly half of all fatal occupational injuries (47.4 percent), representing 1,282 and 976 workplace deaths, respectively.


## Introduction

Motivated by the need to address safety concerns in construction sites, where accidents often occur due to the lack of safety equipment, developed a real-time PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) Detection application. 
The system not only improves safety by ensuring PPE for workers, but also provides a platform for future safety monitoring, such as the possible activation of alerts for immediate response to harmful circumstances.
 

Datasetused - provided by Roboflow on [**Construction Site Safety Image Dataset**](https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-universe-projects/construction-site-safety). 

Dataset link: [**Kaggle Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snehilsanyal/construction-site-safety-image-dataset-roboflow).

The dataset consists of 2801 image samples with labels in YoloV8 format. 

There are 10 classes to detect from the dataset: 
**'Hardhat', 'Mask', 'NO-Hardhat', 'NO-Mask', 'NO-Safety Vest', 'Person', 'Safety Cone', 'Safety Vest', 'machinery', 'vehicle'**
